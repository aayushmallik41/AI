# JARVIS AI – Day 1

Core voice engine:
- Speech recognition
- Text-to-speech
- Continuous loop

# JARVIS AI - Day 2
-WAKE WORD + COMMAND ROUTER
-OBJECTIVE (STRICT)
Jarvis does NOT respond to random speech
Jarvis responds ONLY after hearing “jarvis”
Commands are cleanly separated from wake word
A proper command router exists (no messy if-else)
Code is tested and pushed to GitHub
